# Stock-Event-Inferencer
This program gives short inferences on the reasons for large moves in any S&P500 stock using short NLP analysis of headlines on relevant days.

Future versions will allow for tweet analysis of your searched stock on their most important days.

For now, the project works using a simple Tkinter GUI. Later versions will use better "important day" isolation and be deployed on a website.
